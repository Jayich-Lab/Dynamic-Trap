# Introduction and Motivation
Ion traps are instruments inserted into ultra-high vacuum systems to trap and study ions through the control and manipulation of electric fields. Ion traps have the potential to provide insight into atomic parity non-conservation (APNC) measurements, time-variation of fundamental constants, a potential electric dipole moment, and more. 

The trap build outline in the "Guide" portion of this repo helps to bridge our research which very much lies in the quantum regime, to something that be recreated mechanically. The trap illustrates how oscillating electric fields can create a saddle point potential for a charged particle. In this case the charged particle is a ball, and by adjusting the rotational speed of the trap one can get a sense for how an ion might be trapped.

The final product can be seen below:

# Supplmental Information
Resources on a mechanical analogue to the quadrupole ion trap.

The stp file for the trap surface (saddle) is ready to print -- simply import into MakerBot Print and print.

The base is specific to the motor we used, a Uxcell gearbox motor. Modifications will be necessary if a different motor is used.

The mounting ring is used for mating the saddle to the D-shaped motor shaft. It fits a motor shaft with 6mm diameter with a 0.5mm (at thickest point) flat cut.
