# dynamic-trap
Resources on a mechanical analogue to the quadrupole ion trap.

The stp file for the trap surface (saddle) is ready to print -- simply import into MakerBot Print and print.

The base is specific to the motor we used, a Uxcell gearbox motor. Modifications will be necessary if a different motor is used.

The mounting ring is used for mating the saddle to the D-shaped motor shaft. It fits a motor shaft with 6mm diameter with a 0.5mm (at thickest point) flat cut.
